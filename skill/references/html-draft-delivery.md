# HTML Draft Delivery Gate

The HTML-first draft is the first user-visible checkpoint. It is not a
temporary file that can remain hidden while Pixso is being generated.

## Required order

1. Write the draft to the approved delivery directory, normally
   `/Users/zhaobohai/Desktop/资源管理/我的代码仓/生成产品html/<slug>/index.html`.
   Keep local CSS, SVG, and image references relative to that directory.
2. Run `node scripts/verify-html-artifact.mjs <absolute-html-path>` and fix
   every missing local asset before browser verification.
3. Open that exact file or its local-server URL in the browser at the declared
   desktop viewport, exercise the primary path, and capture a screenshot.
4. Report the clickable HTML path and the browser URL before starting any
   Pixso operation. The user must be able to inspect the draft while Pixso is
   still pending.
5. Continue to Pixso only after the draft checkpoint is visible. If Pixso is
   unavailable or slow, deliver the verified draft and report Pixso as a
   separate pending stage; never hide or delay the HTML artifact behind Pixso.

## Delivery record

The generation record must contain `draftHtmlPath`, `draftBrowserUrl`,
`draftViewport`, `draftVerification`, and `pixsoStatus`. The final response
must include the draft path even when a later Pixso stage fails or is paused.
