# Icon Selection and Semantic Aliases

Use this reference whenever an icon is selected, replaced, or introduced in Pixso or HTML.

## Source authority

Use the first source that provides an approved match:

1. User-provided exact SVG.
2. Existing approved project semantic alias.
3. Lucide for broad product, business, navigation, communication, file, data, device, and industry concepts.
4. HarmonyOS Symbol for platform-specific concepts and already-approved HarmonyOS glyphs.
5. A documented manual fallback.

Never replace a higher-authority asset silently. The Titlebar window-control SVGs are an example of user-provided exact assets and remain authoritative.

## Selection workflow

1. Write the semantic intent as `category/concept`, separating action, object, and state. Examples: `action/add`, `field/search`, `navigation/sidebar-collapse`, `communication/mail-unread`.
2. Translate the concept into canonical English search terms. Search synonyms when the first term is ambiguous.
3. Use `pnpm icons:search -- <query>` to discover Lucide filenames. Shortlist 2–3 plausible candidates.
4. Render candidates at the actual component size: 16px, 20px, or 24px. Compare silhouette, direction, density, and neighboring icons.
5. Choose the closest visual and semantic match, then bind it to a stable project semantic alias.
6. Record any intentionally non-obvious choice near the alias map.

Do not select an icon solely from a Chinese label, the first filename match, or loose visual resemblance. Ask the user only when multiple candidates communicate materially different product meanings.

## Deterministic export workflow

Treat `assets/icons/icon-aliases.json` as the machine-readable source of icon identity. It maps semantic aliases to pinned Lucide names, vendored HarmonyOS SVGs, or exact project assets.

1. Search Lucide by concept when the alias does not exist:

   ```bash
   pnpm icons:search -- reply
   ```

2. Add the approved semantic alias to `assets/icons/icon-aliases.json`. Do not bind reusable markup directly to a guessed filename.
3. Generate exact source geometry from the registry. For a single-file HTML output, inject the sprite directly into the page:

   ```bash
   pnpm icons:export -- \
     --alias action/reply \
     --alias action/forward \
     --html /absolute/path/to/index.html
   ```

   For a multi-file project, emit a shared sprite instead:

   ```bash
   pnpm icons:export -- --aliases action/reply,action/forward --out /absolute/path/to/icons.svg
   ```

4. Reference the generated semantic symbol without copying its geometry:

   ```html
   <svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true">
     <use href="#icon-action-reply"></use>
   </svg>
   ```

5. Run the strict audit before delivery:

   ```bash
   pnpm icons:audit -- /absolute/path/to/index.html
   ```

The exporter imports the installed `lucide@1.24.0` node arrays and serializes them without redrawing paths. Generated symbols record `data-icon-alias`, `data-icon-source`, and the upstream icon name or asset path. The audit regenerates the expected symbol from the pinned source and fails when the delivered geometry differs.

For standalone HTML, prefer the injected sprite because an external `<use>` reference may be restricted when the user opens the page through `file://`. Re-running the exporter replaces the marked sprite block deterministically.

Pixso's HTML importer does not reliably resolve a hidden `<symbol>` sprite.
Keep the browser HTML unchanged, create a separate import copy with
`node scripts/prepare-pixso-html.mjs --in <browser.html> --out <pixso.html>`,
and pass that copy to `code_to_design`. The script preserves the semantic alias,
source provenance, viewBox, display-size token, and source vector geometry while
removing the sprite only from the import copy. A strict Pixso preparation must
resolve every `<use>` and every generated icon must have a semantic alias; a
legacy/native sprite without an alias is allowed only as a temporary migration
warning and must be registered before that icon is used in a new page.

Strict audit treats unregistered `<symbol>` elements and unprovenanced inline SVG geometry as errors. Non-icon SVGs must declare `data-svg-role="logo"`, `illustration`, `chart`, or `decoration`. A true manual icon fallback must declare `data-icon-manual-fallback` and be documented in the project alias decision record.

## Rendering rules

- Standard artboard: 24 × 24.
- Client display sizes: 16px, 20px, and 24px. A legacy 12px token may remain for compatibility, but it does not introduce another client stroke rule.
- Outline icon stroke rule: keep a 1.5px source stroke on the 24 × 24 artboard. Uniformly scaling the SVG root and its internal vectors produces the required effective display widths: 24px → 1.5px, 20px → 1.25px, and 16px → 1px.
- Lucide: outline, 1.5px source stroke, round line cap, round line join.
- Lucide geometry must come from the pinned package through `scripts/export-icon-sprite.mjs`. Keep the 1.5px source stroke on the 24 × 24 geometry and scale the rendered `<svg>` root and internal vectors together; do not edit or independently redraw the exported nodes.
- One icon style only: use the pinned Lucide Regular outline geometry through semantic aliases. HarmonyOS Filled variants are not part of the Text-to-UI icon system and must not be generated, mapped, or selected.
- The bottom-left first-level menu inside the two-level Primary Navigation Shell follows the same Lucide rule as ordinary navigation and component actions; it has no Filled exception.
- Color: inherit `currentColor` from the component state unless a component rule explicitly defines multiple colors.
- Disabled: inherit the component-wide 40% opacity; do not separately fade the icon.
- **Pixso parity:** use `assets/design-system/pixso-icon-map.json`. A Text to UI node must carry a semantic alias, exact SVG source provenance, and a 16px, 20px, or explicitly approved 24px display-size token. `HM Symbol` and `icon_font` are prohibited in newly generated Text to UI components or pages; they may remain only inside unmodified HarmonyOS-native source components.
- Never reduce only a Pixso icon container. Resize the SVG root and its internal vectors together, then centre the resulting geometry in the icon slot.
- **Crop gate:** after code-to-design import, read each icon wrapper and vector
  bounds. The wrapper must use visible overflow, the root and internal vector
  must preserve the same 24 × 24 source geometry, and the display-size token
  must leave the glyph fully inside its slot. A clipped bound, sprite-use
  wrapper, or icon-font conversion fails the Pixso audit; replace it with the
  exact exported SVG or a linked NewComponents instance before continuing.

## Alias contract

Reusable components reference semantic names, not library filenames. An alias may change its underlying source without changing component markup.

```text
field/search              -> lucide/search
field/date                -> harmonyos/calendar
field/time                -> harmonyos/clock
communication/mail       -> lucide/mail
navigation/panel-left    -> lucide/panel-left
navigation/sidebar-collapse -> lucide/panel-left
navigation/sidebar-expand   -> lucide/panel-left
status/info                 -> assets/icons/status/info-circle.svg
status/success              -> assets/icons/status/success-circle.svg
status/warning              -> assets/icons/status/warning-circle.svg
status/danger               -> assets/icons/status/danger-circle.svg
status/neutral              -> assets/icons/status/neutral-circle.svg
window/minimize          -> assets/icons/titlebar/window-minimize.svg
window/maximize          -> assets/icons/titlebar/window-maximize.svg
window/close             -> assets/icons/titlebar/window-close.svg
```

Aliases should be lower-case and slash-separated. Use product meaning in the alias and source identity only on the mapping side.

The code-facing symbol id is deterministic: `action/reply` becomes `#icon-action-reply`. Treat that id as generated output rather than a second hand-maintained alias table.
