# Adaptive Requirement Specification

Use this reference at the start of every text-to-ui run. The goal is not to force the user to complete a form. The skill should understand the request, inspect available materials, ask only high-impact questions, infer the rest, and record its assumptions.

## 1. Intake Principle

```text
User supplies facts, goals, preferences, and corrections.
The design system supplies hard constraints.
The model supplies tool-task reasoning, information architecture, interaction coverage, and sensible defaults.
```

Do not read a fixed questionnaire aloud. Generate questions from the uncertainty of the current task.

## 2. Three Decision Layers

### Hard Constraints

Never change these without explicit user approval:

- Target platform: HarmonyOS PC desktop application.
- Required output for the recorded workflow: HTML-first refinement, visual-first, or direct HTML. Use HTML-first refinement when the user does not explicitly select another mode.
- Approved design-system tokens and component rules.
- Approved layout rules and window dimensions.
- Default generation canvas: HarmonyOS PC desktop `1728 × 1152px` for HTML drafts, Pixso top-level Frames, screenshots, and final visual comparison. A different desktop size requires explicit approval and must be recorded in the requirement contract.
- Explicitly required screens, functions, content, and interactions.
- Explicitly forbidden styles, content, technologies, or behaviors.
- Existing project design truth with higher authority than the bundled baseline.

### Soft Preferences

Honor these by default, but adjust when usability or consistency requires it:

- Style and brand keywords.
- Reference products.
- Information density.
- Preferred shell or pane count.
- Motion strength.
- Content volume.
- Preferred framework when no existing stack requires another choice.

Record the reason when a soft preference is adjusted.

### Model Decisions

Infer these when the user has not specified them:

- Information hierarchy.
- Primary and optional secondary tool type.
- Work-object model and action scope.
- Simplest suitable shell pattern.
- Component composition.
- Secondary actions.
- Realistic labels, copy, and demonstration data.
- Loading, empty, error, success, disabled, selected, and hover states.
- Navigation relationships.
- Which low-risk interactions can be simulated in the demonstration.

## 3. Adaptive Question Policy

Before asking anything:

1. Read the latest user request.
2. Inspect supplied screenshots, Pixso document/top-level Frame references, code, design files, and assets.
3. Record the workflow requested by the user, or default to `html-first` and state that non-blocking assumption.
4. Apply known platform and design-system defaults.
5. Read `tool-design-intelligence.md` and classify the likely user, work object, primary task, tool type, workflow, risk, and state-preservation needs.
6. Identify only uncertainties that would materially change the tool structure, workflow, risk behavior, or delivery scope.

Ask 1–3 concise questions in one round when useful. Ask fewer when possible and default to one round. Do not ask for information already present in the conversation or project files.

High-value question areas:

- Who performs the work, how often, and under what time pressure?
- What is the main work object and what must the user do to it?
- What starts the workflow, what counts as success, and what context must remain stable?
- Which failure, recovery, destructive, publishing, privacy, or permission behaviors materially affect the design?
- Is there existing product behavior, code, Pixso, or a design system with higher authority?

Ask a blocking question only when different answers would create substantially different products, workflows, permissions, sensitive-data behavior, or delivery scope. Otherwise continue with reasonable assumptions.

After the questions or safe inference, show the Tool Task Brief together with a concise proposed solution and ask for explicit confirmation before any renderer or page artifact starts. This is a design-scope review, not a long form. If the user corrects a material decision, revise the proposal and ask for confirmation again. For multi-view, reusable, extension, or redesign work, also save the brief as `design-strategy.md` after confirmation.

## 4. User Input Guidance

A single sentence is sufficient. The user may improve control by supplying any of:

```text
Product and target users
Primary task
Main work object
Usage frequency and time pressure
Required screens/functions
Interactions that must work
Important failure, recovery, permission, or irreversible behavior
Existing design/code/assets
References and style preferences
Forbidden content or behavior
Demonstration scope
```

Do not require the user to translate their idea into design-system language.

## 5. Proposed Solution Confirmation

Use this short review message after requirement analysis and before HTML, Pixso, image, or code generation:

```markdown
## Proposed Solution (confirmation required)
- Design goal:
- Page structure (tree):
  ```text
  ├── 登录
  ├── 注册
  └── 找回密码
  ```
- Key interactions and states:
- Technology/output:
- Assumptions:
- Open questions:
- Confirmation: pending | confirmed
```

Rules:

- Ask at most three high-impact questions in the same message; infer low-risk details.
- “确认”, “可以”, or “按这个做” is explicit approval.
- Any material correction sends the proposal back to `pending` until the user confirms again.
- Do not start a renderer or create a page artifact while confirmation is `pending`.

## 6. Generated Requirement Contract

Create a compact internal or project-level requirement contract before HTML or Pixso generation:

```markdown
# Requirement Contract

## Original Request

## Known Facts
- Product:
- Users:
- Scenario:
- Required functions:
- Existing sources:
- Explicit constraints:

## Proposed Solution

  │   ├── Primary region
  │   └── Secondary region
  └── Overlay or child flow
  ```
- Key interactions and states:
- Technology choice:
- Pixso fidelity target: fast visual import (default) or strict structured reuse:
- NewComponents/native linked instances required: yes / no
- Design canvas: `1728 × 1152px` by default; approved override:
- Assumptions and open questions:

```

Keep this contract concise. It is a tool-task decision record, not a long product requirements document. Platform constants remain authoritative in the layout and interaction references; do not copy their full numeric rules into every contract.

## 7. Fixed HarmonyOS Defaults From Native References

Unless the current workflow requires otherwise:

- Use a `1728 × 1152px` HarmonyOS PC desktop canvas for generated HTML drafts, Pixso top-level Frames, screenshots, and final comparison. If another desktop size is approved, record it in the requirement contract and use it consistently across both renderers and every QA checkpoint.
- Start with a persistent left navigation and a flexible Main region for a full application.
- Use the two-pane shell for browsing, dashboards, settings, stores, media, and content hubs.
- Add a fixed `360px` Secondary Pane for repeated list-to-detail workflows.
- Apply 16px on all four sides of the Secondary Pane scrolling content wrapper; do not add a second outer List inset.
- Let the right Main/Detail/Editor region fill all remaining width.
- Default Main Content and Main Detail to 24px left/right, 16px top, and 0px bottom on their direct scrolling wrapper. Use `edge-aligned` only when the requirement contract explicitly names a canvas, grid, media, map, or file surface that must reach the pane boundary; keep readable content inside the same directional safe area.
- Use the tool-workspace shell when tabs, address/search, command toolbar, and canvas/data view are central to the task.
- Add a separate Inspector only when contextual properties are necessary; do not add it as decoration.
- Use a `64px` non-dialog Global Title Layer.
- Keep the Titlebar component transparent and match each shell segment to the surface of the pane below it. Do not add a horizontal divider below the Primary Navigation or Secondary Pane title segment.
- Put app icon and product name in the top-left Brand Anchor.
- Put every page-global Primary action in the Primary Navigation Shell between Brand Anchor and Sidebar navigation. Use one 40px-high icon + text Primary Button that fills the available width inside the Sidebar's 16px horizontal inset. Keep 8px from Brand Anchor / Titlebar to the button and 12px from the button to the first Sidebar navigation component, using the dedicated action-slot tokens rather than changing whole-navigation or menu gaps. Do not add another page-global Primary elsewhere. In collapsed navigation, keep it as a 40px icon-only Primary Button with an accessible name and Tooltip. Place Secondary, Ghost, Icon, and local buttons elsewhere according to scope.
- Put page title, search, tabs, or view actions in the title context area as the workflow requires.
- Pin application actions and window controls to the top-right, preserving a draggable region.
- Allow Primary Navigation, Secondary Pane, Main Content, and Inspector to scroll independently when needed.
- Keep the system taskbar, launcher, tray, clock, and desktop search outside the application output.
- Treat immersive image, weather, media, and promotional backgrounds as product-specific visual directions, not universal shell defaults.

These defaults come from the bundled native screenshot references. Use `harmonyos-layout-patterns.md` for pattern selection and inspect relevant screenshots only when additional evidence is needed.

## 8. Anti-Patterns

- Do not ask every possible question before making progress.
- Do not expose the full template to the user unless they request it.
- Do not invent a conflicting visual language when approved sources exist.
- Do not use a three- or four-pane shell when a two-pane workflow is sufficient.
- Do not mistake missing detail for permission to ignore critical interactions.
- Do not hide model assumptions; record the ones that materially affect output.
- Do not classify an operations workbench as a marketing or campaign surface.
- Do not apply one global expression level to every module.
