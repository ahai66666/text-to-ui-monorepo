# Existing HTML to Pixso — normal route

Read `references/pixso-import-details.md` and
`references/pixso-execution-invariants.md` for mapping and executor rules.

Use only for an existing, rendered page whose structure is already approved.
The task is exact-output conversion, not product design. Do not read the new-page
route or broad Pixso manuals during a normal run.

## Contract

- Restate URL, `1728 × 1152` CSS viewport unless the user supplied another,
  zoom `1.0`, requested visible state, and “no redesign”.
- Pass the URL through `resolve-pixso-import-url.mjs` before creating a run.
  When a static HTML root is known and a nonexistent suffix was accidentally
  appended to its directory URL, use the corrected directory entry and record
  both URLs in the run manifest. Preserve real files. Use
  `--allow-virtual-route` only for an intentional SPA route.
- The `start` command checks and starts managed services automatically; do not
  ask the user to start the Bridge or Preview Hub separately.
- Use a fresh isolated run under the HTML root's `.text-to-ui/pixso-runs/` or an
  explicitly supplied runs root. Generated evidence is excluded from the HTML
  fingerprint.
- Capture the current browser-computed manifest and exact screenshot once.
- Apply the shared HTML text-sizing contract from
  `references/pixso-fidelity-import-pipeline.md`: fitting text stays intrinsic;
  only measured overflow with HTML ellipsis becomes fixed-width native Pixso
  `TRUNCATE`.
- Compile with the default `dom-visual-ir` pipeline. Browser bounds are the only
  geometry authority; compatible components and Tokens are applied afterward.
- Validate, publish once to the connected plugin, read back once, and compare the
  structured screenshot with the HTML screenshot.

## Normal sequence

```text
automatic services → fresh run → calibrated capture bundle → compile → validate → publish → readback/diff
```

Public lifecycle commands:

```bash
node scripts/pixso-import-orchestrator.mjs start --html-root <root> --url <url> --width 1728 --height 1152 --mode normal
node scripts/pixso-import-orchestrator.mjs capture --run-manifest <run-manifest>
node scripts/pixso-import-orchestrator.mjs compile --run-manifest <run-manifest> --visual-manifest <visual-manifest> --component-map assets/design-system/mapping-registry.json --minimum-selector-coverage 0.95 --minimum-visual-evidence-coverage 0.95
node scripts/pixso-import-orchestrator.mjs publish --run-manifest <run-manifest>
node scripts/pixso-import-orchestrator.mjs diff --run-manifest <run-manifest> --reference <html-reference.png> --actual <pixso-structured.png> --out <visual-diff.json> --pixel-threshold 20 --max-different-ratio 0.005
```

Browser capture is the only browser-tool step. First calibrate the requested CSS
viewport and save its manifest and normalized PNG at the artifact paths declared
by the run. Then call `capture`: it writes the current-run `capture-bundle.json`
only when the PNG's real dimensions, browser viewport, state, fingerprint and
artifact hashes agree. Compile and publish reject a missing, cropped or mutated
bundle before a Pixso draft is created. Do not recapture or retry in normal mode.

`publish` performs plan/run validation, starts the execution stage, and publishes
exactly once. If the plugin panel is closed, report that the user should open it
in the target Pixso file. Keep the same publication waiting for the plugin;
opening the panel claims and executes it automatically without a second user
action or a new import run. A disconnected plugin has a ten-minute opening
window; an already connected plugin has 45 seconds to confirm startup. A
runtime, protocol, or capability mismatch requires loading the current plugin
build. Do not auto-fallback to MCP or repeatedly create new runs. A timed-out
publication is terminal and requires a fresh run.

The plugin creates one hidden managed draft. It swaps that draft into the
canonical position only after readback succeeds and removes it on pause or
failure, so a normal import leaves exactly one managed artboard.

## Outcome classification and stopping

- Separate **page presence** from **acceptance quality**. Read the current
  run-manifest and the single plugin result; inspect their phase, failed
  module/operation, and canonical-frame commit status. A lone `ok: false` or
  module-level component/icon/color readback message is not proof that no page
  was imported.
- Component fallback, component-slot/icon readback, or visual-audit issues do
  not make an acceptance gate pass, but report them separately from whether the
  top-level page exists.
- If the current-run root was committed to the target page, or the user
  explicitly confirms they can see the page in Pixso, report **page imported**
  and list any outstanding execution/quality warning separately. Stop there:
  do not investigate component details, publish again, or edit the canvas
  unless the user asks.
- If the user has not confirmed the page is present and the run state does not
  identify a committed root, allow at most one targeted read-only check of the
  expected target page/frame. Do not perform broad component inspection to
  decide page presence.
- If no current-run frame was committed and the failed phase is structural
  execution/commit/readback, report **import incomplete** with the exact phase.
  Do not retry or create a new run for the same failure; use
  `converter-diagnosis` only when further diagnosis is requested or required.

Stop further writes when source hashes, run IDs, viewport/state, geometry
coverage, plugin version, or schema/preflight fails. An execution, readback, or
visual-diff failure stops the current publication, but use the outcome
classification above before saying the page itself was not imported. Never
weaken a gate or replay the plan.

Normal target: 30–90 seconds wall time. Capture and compile should normally take
seconds; if orchestration dominates, report its exact stage rather than calling
the converter slow.
